# Mobile App Design and Content Specification

This document contains the design specifications and text content for the mobile application, based on the website `github.com/rongeorge74`.

---

## Part 1: Design Specification

This section outlines the design language of the existing website to be used for the new mobile application.

### Color Palette

The website uses a theming system with CSS variables. Based on the CSS, here is an estimated color palette:

- **Accent Color:** A gradient from a primary accent color to a light purple.
  - `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--accent), #a78bfa)`
  - Let's assume `var(--accent)` is a vibrant color like a shade of purple or blue. For the purpose of this document, let's assume it's a color like `#8b5cf6` (Violet 500 from Tailwind CSS).
- **Primary Text Color:** `var(--text-primary)` - Likely a dark color for light mode and a light color for dark mode.
  - Light Mode: `#111827` (Gray 900)
  - Dark Mode: `#f9fafb` (Gray 50)
- **Navigation Background:** `var(--nav-bg)` - A semi-transparent color for the glassmorphism effect.
  - Light Mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`
  - Dark Mode: `rgba(17, 24, 39, 0.8)`
- **Navigation Border:** `var(--nav-border)` - A subtle border for the navigation bar.
  - Light Mode: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
  - Dark Mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- **Navigation Highlight:** `var(--nav-highlight)` - A highlight for the navigation bar.
  - Light Mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)`
  - Dark Mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- **Navigation Shadow:** `var(--nav-shadow)` - A shadow for the navigation bar.
  - Light Mode: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
  - Dark Mode: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- **Navigation Link Hover:** `var(--nav-link-hover)` - Background color for hovered navigation links.
  - Light Mode: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`
  - Dark Mode: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)`

### Typography

- **Logo:**
  - Font Size: `1.8rem`
  - Font Weight: `800`
  - Letter Spacing: `-.5px`
- **Navigation Links:**
  - Font Size: `.95rem`
  - Font Weight: `500`

### Layout

- **Max Content Width:** `1400px`
- **Navigation Padding:** `1rem 0` (top/bottom), `0 3rem` (left/right)

### Effects

- **Glassmorphism:** The navigation bar uses a `backdrop-filter: blur()` effect to create a frosted glass look. This is a key design element.
- **Shadows:** `box-shadow` is used to create depth and lift elements off the background.
- **Transitions:** `transition` properties are used for smooth animations on hover and other interactions.

### Components

- **Navbar:**
  - Fixed position at the top of the screen.
  - Contains the logo, navigation links, and a theme toggle button.
  - Becomes more blurred and has a stronger shadow when the user scrolls.
- **Navigation Links:**
  - Have a hover effect that changes the background color and text color.
  - The active link has a colored indicator bar underneath it.
- **Theme Toggle:**
  - A button to switch between light and dark modes.

### Content

The website is a personal portfolio for Ron George. The mobile app should display the same information, which likely includes:

- A home page with a brief introduction.
- An "About Me" section.
- A "Projects" section showcasing his work.
- A "Resume" or "CV" section with a downloadable PDF.
- A "Contact" section.

This information is based on the analysis of the `index.html` and the partial CSS file. The JavaScript file was minified and could not be analyzed. Further analysis of the running website would be beneficial to get the exact color values and content.
