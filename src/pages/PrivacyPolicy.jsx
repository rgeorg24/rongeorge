                    <p className="last-updated">Last updated: December 2, 2024</p>

                    <p>Ron George ("we", "us", or "our") operates the mobile application (the "App").</p>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

                    <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
                    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users of the App. The App does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</p>

                    <h2>2. Permissions and Device Data</h2>
                    <p>The App does not request access to sensitive device permissions (such as camera, microphone, contacts, or location). If this changes in a future version, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

                    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or other services that collect personal or usage data from within the App.</p>

                    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>Because we do not collect any personal information, our App does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13 (or any other age as defined by applicable law).</p>

                    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

                    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the App, you can contact us at:</p>
